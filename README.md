# Unified Intelligent Service & Resolution Hub for Winchester Dynamics (Salesforce Project)

**Project by: Srihari Rai**
**Date Started: 5/10/25** 

## 1. Project Purpose & Problem Statement

**Purpose:**
This project aims to design and prototype a comprehensive, Salesforce-based "Unified Intelligent Service & Resolution Hub" tailored for a diversified technology company like **Winchester Dynamics**. The Hub will streamline and automate the end-to-end case lifecycle for complex technology products and solutions, from initial customer contact through to resolution, by intelligently routing, enriching, and managing cases and their associated service level agreements (SLAs).

**Problem Statement (Inspired by challenges at complex tech organizations like Honeywell Process Solutions):**
Large, diversified technology companies supporting a vast portfolio of products, software, and integrated solutions (across divisions like Building Technologies, Safety & Productivity Solutions (SPS), Aerospace, and Process Solutions) often face significant challenges in their global customer care (GCC) and global technical assistance (GTAC) operations. These challenges include:

*   **Case Misdirection & Inefficient Handoffs:** Difficulty in quickly routing customer issues to the correct specialized internal team, leading to delays and customer frustration.
*   **Knowledge Silos:** Disparate expertise across product lines, making it hard for agents to access the right information promptly.
*   **Complex SLA & Entitlement Management:** Accurately applying and tracking varied service contracts and SLAs for different customers and products.
*   **Repetitive Triage & Data Collection:** Manual effort spent on preliminary questions and diagnostics.
*   **Inefficient Escalation Paths:** Delays in escalating critical issues to specialized teams with all necessary context.
*   **Global Team Coordination:** Ensuring consistent service quality across geographically dispersed support teams.

This Hub aims to address these pain points by leveraging Salesforce Service Cloud and advanced automation capabilities.

## 2. Project Vision

The "Unified Intelligent Service & Resolution Hub" will provide Winchester Dynamics with:
*   A 360-degree view of customer support interactions.
*   Intelligent case triage and routing to appropriate GCC/GTAC tiers and specialized teams.
*   Automated application and tracking of SLAs via Entitlement Management.
*   Integration with a centralized Knowledge Base for faster resolutions.
*   Guided diagnostic and escalation processes for support agents.
*   Proactive monitoring of case aging and SLA compliance.
*   Enhanced reporting and analytics on support operations.

## 3. Technology Stack
*   Salesforce Platform (Developer Edition Org)
*   Salesforce Service Cloud features
*   Salesforce Flow (for automation)
*   VS Code with Salesforce Extension Pack (for development and metadata management)
*   Git & GitHub (for version control and portfolio showcase)

## 4. Project Stages & Progress
